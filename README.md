# Neural Networks for Predictive Analysis in Men's College Basketball

**(Upload Still in Progress, Website Coming Soon)**

Predictive analysis for any sport is a notoriously difficult task. Current research suggests that small **neural networks** (3-Layer Network) [1] and ensemble models such as **extra tree classifiers** and **gradient boosting** [2] can be effective in addressing these challenges. This project aims to expand upon previous research by training individual Multi-Layer Perceptron models for each of 15 basketball metrics: **GP**, **GS**, **MIN/G**, **FG%**, **3PT%**, **FT%**, **PPG**, **REB/G**, **OFF_REB/G**, **DEF_REB/G**, **PF/G**, **AST/G**, **TO/G**, **STL/G**, **BLK/G**, predicting each for a player's subsequent year of data. Additionally, this project attempts to understand how the level of play across Division I and Division II affects outcomes when a player switches between the two or within divisions. For example, if a player transfers from Point Loma Nazarene (a higher-level Division II team) to UC San Diego (a lower-level Division I team) or from UC San Diego to UConn (a higher-level Division I team), some accounting for level of play adjustment needs to be considered. A novel approach was taken in which a value was assigned to each conference's "perceived score" of competition from 0-2 (with 0 being the lowest and 2 the highest). To account for a large number of variables, careful emphasis was placed on finding similar players based on their stats, level of play similarities, and progression, and incorporating this into the model architecture. The project is divided into three parts: Scraping, Training, and Inference. The final aim is to create a robust model that not only predicts future performance with high accuracy but also adapts to the nuances of inter-divisional play, ultimately providing insights into how changes in competition level can influence player performance.
