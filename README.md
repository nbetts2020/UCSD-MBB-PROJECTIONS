# Neural Networks for Predictive Analysis in Men's College Basketball

**(Upload Still in Progress, Website Coming Soon)**

Predictive analysis for any sport is a notoriously difficult task. Current research suggests that small **neural networks** (3-Layer Network) [1] and ensemble models such as **extra tree classifiers** and **gradient boosting** [2] can be effective in addressing these challenges. This project aims to expand upon previous research by training individual Multi-Layer Perceptron models for each of 15 basketball metrics: **GP**, **GS**, **MIN/G**, **FG%**, **3PT%**, **FT%**, **PPG**, **REB/G**, **OFF_REB/G**, **DEF_REB/G**, **PF/G**, **AST/G**, **TO/G**, **STL/G**, **BLK/G**, predicting each for a player's subsequent year of data. Additionally, this project attempts to understand how the level of play across Division I and Division II affects outcomes when a player switches between the two or within divisions. For example, if a player transfers from Point Loma Nazarene (a higher-level Division II team) to UC San Diego (a lower-level Division I team) or from UC San Diego to UConn (a higher-level Division I team), some accounting for level of play adjustment needs to be considered. A novel approach was taken in which a value was assigned to each conference's "perceived score" of competition from 0-2 (with 0 being the lowest and 2 the highest). To account for a large number of variables, careful emphasis was placed on finding similar players based on their stats, level of play similarities, and progression, and incorporating this into the model architecture. The project is divided into three parts: Scraping, Training, and Inference. The final aim is to create a robust model that not only predicts future performance with high accuracy but also adapts to the nuances of inter-divisional play, ultimately providing insights into how changes in competition level can influence player performance.
## Scraping
The goal was to obtain the last six years of data, starting in 2018-2019 and ending in 2023-2024 (though the code is setup to get the most current season, March 18th being the cutoff date for a new season). There's a few sites to scrape this information from including barttorvik.com or espn.com, but scraping data from each team's respective website was by far the most reliable in terms of normalized data. The process looks something like this: with a list of Division I and Division II Men's Basketball Schools and for each year from 2018-2019 to 2023-2024 (or current year), two things were scraped - the team's roster (something like: https://ucsdtritons.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster) and the individual overall cumulative statistics table (something like: https://ucsdtritons.com/sports/mens-basketball/stats/). From here, the two tables were merged, now allowing for the player's position to be added as a feature. The scraping used a mix of BeatifulSoup and Selenium, as each team website varied on their HTML structure - for example, some cumulative statistics tables were PDFs, while others were pure HTML. After repeated for nearly 700 teams and 6+ years of data, the data was manipulated to reflect the values we wanted to predict. Counting statistics were transformed into "per game" stats (PTS -> PPG = PTS / GP (Games Played)) and other columns such 'Conference' (conference of each player's team), 'Conference_Grade' (score from 0-2 reflecting competition of play in a team's conference), and 'Occurrence' (year of eligibility for player, Freshmen would generally be 1, Sophomores 2, etc.).
